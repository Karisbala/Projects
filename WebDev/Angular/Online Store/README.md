# Online Store

## Project Description

This project is an online store that allows users to view and purchase products. The project is developed using Angular.

### Features

-   The project includes a "Products" component that shows a list of products, each with an image, name, description, and rating. Each product is linked to a real item from Kaspi.kz. There are at least 10 products in the list.
-   Buttons "Share" are implemented for each product, allowing users to share the product link via WhatsApp or Telegram.
-   A product image gallery has been added with a minimum of 3 images.
-   The project includes a hierarchy of categories and product items. There are 4 categories, each with 5 products.
-   Three components have been created: App, ProductList, and ProductItem. The App component shows a list of categories, and when a category is selected, the products in that category are rendered using the ProductList and ProductItem components.
-   Each ProductItem object is removable and includes an extra field for likes. When the "Like" button is clicked, the number of likes for that product is increased.
